## Memory Game
------------

**Where?** [Live demo](http://example.com/)

**What?** A [memory game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(card_game)), where eight pairs of cards are laid face down on a 4x4 grid surface. Two cards can be flipped face up at a time. The objective of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards, and to match all cards.

**Why?** I did this project because I wanted to become better familiar with CSS Grid and CSS transformations. A memory game was one of the ideas I had for accomplishing this. I chose to go with images of paintings because of copyright and public domain.

**How?** Built with JavaScript and CSS, notably CSS Grid and CSS transformations.

**Main difficulty?** No major difficulty -- except for perhaps CSS being tricky at times, as well as the coupling of CSS and JS.
